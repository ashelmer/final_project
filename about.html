    <h1>Here's a Little About Me</h1>
</header>

    <h2>
        Where I go to School
    </h2>
    <p>
        I am currently enrolled at Union College, A small Adventist college in Lincoln Nebraska,
        I'm in my Junior year studying Finance and I've also picked up a minor in IT which is why
        a Finance major is taking a web development course.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Favorite Hobbies
    </h2>
    <p>
        I enjoy playing video games and from that came an interest in learning how to actually make video games for myself. That is part of why I picked up computer science courses and I've even begun teaching myself C# and how to use it within Unity. Another one of my favorite hobbies is football, I'm a big Chiefs fan.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Plans for the Future
    </h2>
    <p>
        Although the future is always uncertain, I do have some plans for it. I'll be getting married in less than a year and I'll be graduating in just a little more than a year from now. I'll most likely end up back in Kansas City and begin working as a Financial Analyst.
